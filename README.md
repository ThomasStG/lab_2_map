- Comments: I chose to put a form and the marker list on the side of the page and
  hide them when the user selects "Finish". Marker colors are determined by
  whether the user has saved each marker.

- Usage: To run the program run:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  in the terminal.
  Once the page is open, click on the map to add markers. When you are
  done, click the "Finish" button. Markers can be edited by clicking on
  them or by clicking on them in the marker list. Markers can be deleted
  by clicking on them or by clicking on them in the marker list and selecting "Delete".
